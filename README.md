# code-test-dotnet-jsonloader
Straight forward code test created for prospective candidates

## Purpose
In order to assess candidates with practical programming skills, I created a code test to be used in the interview process. I tried to leave the code test as open ended as possible but also built a framework for the candidate to operate in. During the interview we would discuss design decisions and implementation details. I would also ask questions about how to extend the application in various ways. Teams at the company also opted to pair program with candidates.

## Next Steps
I would love to create an API to have candidates work against and add tests to the solution. Alternatively, requiring the candidates to unit test the application could also be desirable. A more defined rubric for evaluation can also be valuable.
